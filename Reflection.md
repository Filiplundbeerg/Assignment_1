# Assignment_1
1.
  I feel like I started to learn a bit about the syntax. As I've done most of my  previous work in C# there were some things I didn't expect to  be that different, at least from
  what I've done thus far. The tasks in themselves would've taken 1h in C#  but I got stuck at these  "basic" things which should just work, provided you  know the syntax. I ould say i know how  to think like a programmer if I may say so.  I've also learned  basic github features.
2.  As I said, the syntax and figuring out these  small details such as  how printf_s and printf worked, the difference between them and how to avoid getting errors and warnings and  such. I  asked the teacher for help and he gladly accepted  the challenge to provide an explanation!
